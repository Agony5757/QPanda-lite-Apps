# QPanda-lite-Apps
Applications for QPanda-lite.

## Prerequisites

### ALL-IN-ONE support 

All-in-one support includes all requirements for IBM, OriginQ, and Quafu quantum computers.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Load your account and platform info

Just execute the template with filled information.

(Recommend: copy the template to every experiment as step0.)
## Contribute to this repository

You can add a directory according to its category, including:
    
- ibm
    
    IBM experiments.

- quafu

    Quafu experiments.

- originq

    OriginQ experiments.
    
- general

    This includes well-written platform-independent quantum experiments that can be easily migrated.

### Contribute to qpandalite

Because qpandalite is under development, you may always encounter issues or feel uncomfortable when doing experiments. You are always welcome to put up issues or submit codes to the [QPanda-lite](https://github.com/Agony5757/QPanda-lite) repository.

<!-- ## Style

The quantum program is usually executed asynchronously because you may encounter a very-very-long waiting time or instability of the device. In order to write the program more clearly, we can write it step-by-step to show every-->
